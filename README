This is a so-called GIT superproject. The purpose of an superproject is to
aggregate more projects into one repository, so the developer doesn't need
to manage every project separately.

This repository contains these projects:
- map2x-core    - Core Map2X library
- map2x-qt      - Map2X GUI written in Qt

INITIALIZATION:

GIT doesn't automatically fetch all submodules upon cloning, it has to be done
manually. To initialize submodules, run

    git submodule init

This will initialize the submodule configuration in .git/config. You can then
modify submodule URLs for your local setup, if you want. The run

    git submodule update

to fetch all sub-repositories. This command should be run after every git pull,
but it can also cause data loss. More info in GIT manual.
